      <h3> Site Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose with this project is to share information regarding the available business sites surrounding the Idaho Falls area. I want people to know what businesses are available to them and the kind of services they provide. By using this website you should be able to know your options after having recently moved here.</p>

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Garamond
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font looks very professional and clean. It would draw me to reading the said content under the heading.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Helvetica
      </h4>
      <p>
        Helvetica is just a clean easy reading font. Im using it for my paragraphs so that they can look brighter and nicer. Also Helvetica just sounds cool.
